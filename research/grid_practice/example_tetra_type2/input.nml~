! This is an example of construciton type = 2.
! Router = 10.0 is positive. Then, the outer boundary will be at distance 10.
! If you set Router = -10.0 (any negataive), then the code will use the
! growth_rate = 1.2 to generate an outer region. Not sure where exactly the
! outer boundary will be located in this case.
